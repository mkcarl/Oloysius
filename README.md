# Oloysius
Oloysius chat bot for CraftHack hackathon. 

## What we plan to do : 
- A chatbot which can be access through either a web app (DialogFlow Demo), or a slack bot. 
- Users are able to ask the chatbot questions with all the given data.

## Additional features in mind :

- Deployment of bot in multiple Social Platform to enable ease of access
